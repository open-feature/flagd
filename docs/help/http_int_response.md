# HTTP(S) Service Integer Response Behavior

Why is my `int` response a `string`?
Command:

```sh
curl -X POST "localhost:8013/schema.v1.Service/ResolveInt" -d '{"flagKey":"myIntFlag","context":{}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Result:

```sh
{"value":"1","reason":"DEFAULT","variant":"one"}
```

When interacting directly with the flagD http(s) api and requesting an `int` the response type will be a `string`.
This behaviour is introduced by [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway), which uses [proto3 json mapping](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json) to build the response object.
If a number value is required, and none of the provided SDK's can be used, then it is recommended to use the `float64` endpoint instead:  

Command:

```sh
curl -X POST "localhost:8013/schema.v1.Service/ResolveFloat" -d '{"flagKey":"myIntFlag","context":{}}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Result:

```sh
{"value":1.23,"reason":"DEFAULT","variant":"one"}
```
