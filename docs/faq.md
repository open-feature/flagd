# Frequently Asked Questions

> Why do I need this? Can't I just use environment variables?

Feature flags are not environment variables.
If you need to update your flag values without restarting your application, target specific users, randomly assign values for experimentation, or perform scheduled roll-outs, you should consider using feature flags.
If the values are always static, an environment variable or static configuration may be sufficient.

For more information on feature-flagging concepts, see [feature-flagging](./concepts/feature-flagging.md).
