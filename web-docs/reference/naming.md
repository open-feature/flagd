# Naming

_flagd_ was conceived as a simple program with a POSIX-style CLI that's designed to run as a service or [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)).
For this reason, its name is stylized as all lower case: "flagd", consistent with other famous Unix/Linux daemons (_crond_, _sshd_, _systemd_, _ntpd_, _httpd_, etc).
Although the flagd system has expanded beyond the flagd application itself to include libraries which embed flagd's evaluation engine, the "flagd" stylization should be observed for all components relating to flagd.
Where possible, please treat "flagd" as a single word, including in library names, packages, variable names, etc.
