## Kubernetes

flagd was designed with cloud-native paradigms in mind.
You can run it as a sidecar, or as a central service in your cluster.
If you're interested in a full-featured solution for using flagd in Kubernetes, consider the [OpenFeature operator](https://github.com/open-feature/open-feature-operator).

<!-- for now, we are just linking out to the OFO README, but eventually we should consider fully documenting OFO here. -->
